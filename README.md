# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:  import math
### Step 2: assign the given values to the variables
### Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: now print the restult by rounding off the result by using round function
### Step 5: End the program
### PROGRAM:

import math as ma
x1,y1=4,2
x2,y2=10,6
result = ma.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)
print(round(result,2))
~~~

### RESULT:
finally we get the distance between two points
